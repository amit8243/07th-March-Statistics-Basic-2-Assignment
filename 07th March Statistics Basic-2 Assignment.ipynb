    "\"\"\"Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The three measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a \n",
    "set and then dividing by the number of items in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in order from least \n",
    "to greatest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a set of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the\n",
    "central tendency of a dataset?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to describe a dataset. The \n",
    "mean is the average of all the values in a dataset, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing \n",
    "by the number of values. The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is sorted in numerical order. The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency and is useful for describing the average \n",
    "value of a dataset. The median is useful for describing the middle value of a dataset, and can be used \n",
    "to identify outliers. The mode is useful for describing the most common value in a dataset.\n",

    "\"\"\"Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\"\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Measures of dispersion are used to describe the spread of a dataset by providing information about \n",
    "how much the values in the dataset vary from one another. \n",
    "For example, the range of a dataset is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the \n",
    "dataset. The variance is a measure of how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean. \n",
    "The standard deviation is a measure of how much the values in the dataset differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset of 10 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The range of this \n",
    "dataset is 9 (10 - 1 = 9). The variance is 8.33 (the sum of the squared differences from the mean \n",
    "divided by the number of values in the dataset). The standard deviation is 2.87 (the square root of the\n",
    "variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures of dispersion can be used to describe the spread of the dataset and provide information \n",
    "about how much the values in the dataset vary from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between two or more sets of data.\n",
    "It consists of overlapping circles, each representing a set, with the area of overlap representing the \n",
    "elements that are shared between the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:\n",
    "(i) A⋂B\n",
    "(ii) AUB\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "1) A⋂B = (2,,6)\n",
    "2) AUB = (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It measures the degree to \n",
    "which a distribution is shifted or “skewed” to one side or the other. Positive skewness indicates that \n",
    "the data values tend to be concentrated on the left side of the distribution, while negative skewness \n",
    "indicates that the data values tend to be concentrated on the right side of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The median will be less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in\n",
    "statistical analysis?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two variables vary together. It measures the linear \n",
    "relationship between two variables and can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. \n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two \n",
    "variables and can range from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are both used in statistical analysis to measure the strength of the \n",
    "relationship between two variables. Covariance is used to determine if two variables are related, \n",
    "while correlation is used to determine the strength of that relationship. Correlation is often used to \n",
    "determine the strength of a linear relationship between two variables, while covariance is used to \n",
    "measure the degree of change in one variable relative to changes in another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a\n",
    "dataset.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The formula for calculating the sample mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Mean = (Sum of all values in the dataset) / (Number of values in the dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "Let's say we have a dataset with the following values: 2, 4, 6, 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4\n",
    "Sample Mean = 20 / 4\n",
    "Sample Mean = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the sample mean for this dataset is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central \n",
    "tendency?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The measure of central tendency for a normal distribution data is the mean, median, and mode. \n",
    "All three measures are equal in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two variables change together, while correlation is\n",
    "a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Covariance can take on any \n",
    "value from negative infinity to positive infinity, while correlation is always between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is used to measure the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while \n",
    "correlation is used to measure the strength of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion by skewing the data. \n",
    "For example, if the average height of a group of people is 5'10\", but one person in the group is 7' \n",
    "tall, then the average height will be skewed higher than it would have been without the outlier. \n",
    "Similarly, outliers can affect measures of dispersion such as the standard deviation. If the standard \n",
    "deviation of a group of people's heights is 2 inches, but one person in the group is 7' tall, then the \n",
    "standard deviation will be much higher than it would have been  without the outlier."
